Changes in the Code: 1.Use of defaultdict(int) and defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)): defaultdict(int): This initializes the dictionary with an integer default value of 0, so whenever a new key is accessed for the first time, its value will start at 0. defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int)): This initializes a dictionary of dictionaries, where the inner dictionary also has a default integer value of 0. This structure allows nested dictionaries to be created dynamically when accessing new keys. 2.Key Changes in the For Loop: The loop now iterates over the words except for the last two (words[:-2]). Instead of considering just a single word (word) as in the original code, this version concatenates two consecutive words (word + ' ' + words[i+1]) and treats them as a single unit (a bigram). It then records how often this bigram (two-word combination) occurs and which word comes after it.\n",

    "(1)In general, chatbots explain the Monty Hall problem quickly. My door choice = all door options list[0] is one of the lines in the Monte Hall problem code that the ChatBot could easily explain to me when I gave it a TUT demo and engaged with it to learn how each part functions(This indicates that the player's choice is now switched to the remaining door in all_door_options_list.)Additionally, like in Question 2, it may point to a more straightforward and efficient method of coding up. By demonstrating the initial iteration of the \"Markovian ChatBot code,\" I am better able to comprehend how that initial version operated. About question 5, for both extensions (character-specific and bigrams), the ChatBot was fairly quick in offering explanations, though it initially reverted to the simpler, word-based Markov chain model. With a bit of guidance, it adapted quickly, providing more relevant responses .In the third session, where I skipped the intermediate steps and went straight to the final extension, the ChatBot required more prompting but was still able to figure out the functionality once I offered clarifications. There could be a slight lag in getting precise answers that might involve programming simulations.Its flexibility in adjusting to more complex code logic was evident, although it relied on the hints I provided. As a result, the chatbot can also gently and step-by-step teach me something that I haven't studied before. Additionally, chatbots are capable of comprehending more complex final extensions without the need for intermediate extension code; nevertheless, in situations when they don't seem to understand what I'm saying, I should occasionally prompt them with some advice. Chatbots offer prompt and efficient assistance, which is beneficial for explaining ideas, correcting basic mistakes, and providing examples."

    "(2)Whether or not interacting with ChatBot to try to figure things out was frustrating or unhelpful mostly depends on the complexity of the code and whether the instructions I provided are accurate enough. For basic concepts like the Monty Hall problem, there was little frustration.  If the prompt is too vague or complex, its responses may require further clarification, which can lead to some back-and-forth before reaching a satisfactory solution. Especially when I ask the chatbot to understand more complicated extensions, such as Question 5.3, without ever providing the intermediate extension code. \n",

At the same time, there are moments when the chatbot's output is overly complex, and I have to sift through a lot of information to find the results I really want. When dealing with detailed bugs or intricate logic issues, while the ChatBot can offer potential solutions, it isn’t always as quick or helpful as a human tutor who can see the entire problem context."

    "（3）Based on my experiences so far, I would rate the usefulness of ChatBots for understanding code as highly beneficial, especially for conceptual explanations and troubleshooting common issues. Most of the time, in the case of simple instructions, chatbot can quickly understand my needs and fulfill them. It is valuable for explaining concepts, fixing simple errors, and providing examples. Chatbit offers helpful guidance when trying to implement new algorithms or structures, like Markov chains, providing both theoretical explanations and code snippets. Even if the first response isn’t perfect, the ChatBot is patient and iterative, allowing for back-and-forth to arrive at a solution. Compared to search engines like Google, chatbot can focus on the individual code and write unique and personalized code comments for me, rather than giving a broad explanation of the general meaning of a particular command.When dealing with coding errors, ChatBots is great for spotting common mistakes such as syntax errors, misused functions, or basic logic flaws. It can guide me to potential solutions by pointing out issues in the code or offering suggestions to improve my logic, rather than having to search online and troubleshoot step by step.For example, when asking when \"NameError: name 'pd' is not defined\" happens, chatbot will tell me the meaning of this sentence and how to improve it. However, for more intricate or complex problems, ChatBots can sometimes struggle to provide the correct answer without extensive guidance. And it sometimes revert to basic explanations when more detail is needed while sometimes the answers are so broad that I have to spend time searching for and refining the information I need the most. But in most cases, chatbot is very useful for me as a beginner."

    "Before the STA130 class, I rarely used chatbot to help me study and solve problems. When the professor introduced the concept of chatbot and applied it in the classroom, I truly experienced the efficiency and convenience of chatbot. The range of problems that chatbots can solve is very broad, from explaining the meaning behind a piece of code to explaining the entire Monte Hall problem and \"World War 2 planes.\" It can accurately explain and resolve my doubts.Unlike humans, chatbots can cleverly avoid the cognitive traps that humans easily fall into.

Chatbot has been invaluable in not only providing solutions but also explaining the \"why\" behind the solutions, reinforcing my conceptual understanding.\n",

I am used to learning unknown concepts by chatbot instead of searching online, which may waste time sifting through valid information. For example, in Markovian, Chatbot explained this entirely new concept to me and, under my guidance, completed the interpretation of complex code. Its potential to enhance problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of coding, statistics and data science is significant."

    "(1)In general, chatbots explain the Monty Hall problem quickly. My door choice = all door options list[0] is one of the lines in the Monte Hall problem code that the ChatBot could easily explain to me when I gave it a TUT demo and engaged with it to learn how each part functions(This indicates that the player's choice is now switched to the remaining door in all_door_options_list.)Additionally, like in Question 2, it may point to a more straightforward and efficient method of coding up. By demonstrating the initial iteration of the \"Markovian ChatBot code,\" I am better able to comprehend how that initial version operated. About question 5, for both extensions (character-specific and bigrams), the ChatBot was fairly quick in offering explanations, though it initially reverted to the simpler, word-based Markov chain model.  With a bit of guidance, it adapted quickly, providing more relevant responses .In the third session, where I skipped the intermediate steps and went straight to the final extension, the ChatBot required more prompting but was still able to figure out the functionality once I offered clarifications. There could be a slight lag in getting precise answers that might involve programming simulations.Its flexibility in adjusting to more complex code logic was evident, although it relied on the hints I provided. As a result, the chatbot can also gently and step-by-step teach me something that I haven't studied before. \n",
    "Additionally, chatbots are capable of comprehending more complex final extensions without the need for intermediate extension code; nevertheless, in situations when they don't seem to understand what I'm saying, I should occasionally prompt them with some advice.\n",
    "Chatbots offer prompt and efficient assistance, which is beneficial for explaining ideas, correcting basic mistakes, and providing examples."

    "(2)Whether or not interacting with ChatBot to try to figure things out was frustrating or unhelpful mostly depends on the complexity of the code and whether the instructions I provided are accurate enough. For basic concepts like the Monty Hall problem, there was little frustration. \n",
    "If the prompt is too vague or complex, its responses may require further clarification, which can lead to some back-and-forth before reaching a satisfactory solution. Especially when I ask the chatbot to understand more complicated extensions, such as Question 5.3, without ever providing the intermediate extension code. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this wasn’t particularly frustrating because the ChatBot usually was directed to provide Python code to simulate the problem or steer the conversation towards a solution within a few iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the answers provided by the chatbot are too simplistic, and I need to input more instructions to guide it towards deeper thinking. At the same time, there are moments when the chatbot's output is overly complex, and I have to sift through a lot of information to find the results I really want. When dealing with detailed bugs or intricate logic issues, while the ChatBot can offer potential solutions, it isn’t always as quick or helpful as a human tutor who can see the entire problem context."

    "Chatbit offers helpful guidance when trying to implement new algorithms or structures, like Markov chains, providing both theoretical explanations and code snippets.\n",
    "Even if the first response isn’t perfect, the ChatBot is patient and iterative, allowing for back-and-forth to arrive at a solution.\n",
    "Compared to search engines like Google, chatbot can focus on the individual code and write unique and personalized code comments for me, rather than giving a broad explanation of the general meaning of a particular command.When dealing with coding errors, ChatBots is great for spotting common mistakes such as syntax errors, misused functions, or basic logic flaws. It can guide me to potential solutions by pointing out issues in the code or offering suggestions to improve my logic, rather than having to search online and troubleshoot step by step.For example, when asking when \"NameError: name 'pd' is not defined\" happens, chatbot will tell me the meaning of this sentence and how to improve it. However, for more intricate or complex problems, ChatBots can sometimes struggle to provide the correct answer without extensive guidance. And it sometimes revert to basic explanations when more detail is needed while sometimes the answers are so broad that I have to spend time searching for and refining the information I need the most.\n",

    "Additionally, the ability to ask follow-up questions, receive tailored responses, and improve the answer based on dialogue is something traditional resources, like textbooks, don't offer. Chatbots can provide targeted answers to questions rather than just vaguely pointing out a general direction or leaving me to explore on my own. I am used to learning unknown concepts by chatbot instead of searching online, which may waste time sifting through valid information. For example, in Markovian, Chatbot explained this entirely new concept to me and, under my guidance, completed the interpretation of complex code. Its potential to enhance problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of coding, statistics and data science is significant.\n"

    "(4).Based on our previous conversation, I’ve gained a clearer understanding of the skills essential for a career in data science, such as coding, data analysis, communication, and adaptability. I understand that having specialized knowledge is crucial for pursuing a data-related job, such as being proficient in programming languages (like Python and R). I need to focus on building these technical skills.Secondly, communication is an unavoidable aspect of daily work life. To become a data analyst, I must possess good communication skills to report findings.Finally, regardless of the job position, we need to have the ability to learn new things. The world is changing rapidly, which requires us to continuously update our knowledge.I believe I can pursue my interest in data science by committing to continuous learning and gaining practical experience through projects or internships. These hands-on experiences will be key to building the skills and confidence needed to advance in this career."

    "(5).The ChatBot was helpful in providing a broad understanding of the skills necessary for a career in data science and adjacent roles. It helped me to map out the core competencies required and offered some alternative career paths if coding aren't my strengths. However, the ideas provided by Chatbot are quite ordinary, and most people can come up with them. The conversation felt somewhat surface-level, lacking the depth and specificity that could come from a subject matter expert with real-world experience.\n",
